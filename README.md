Hi, I'm Najee Simmons. 

I love to solve problems -- it's my way of making people's lives better. I see software development as the art of devising valuable solutions and I'm excited to work in a field where I get to help others by addressing the challenges they face. 

I make it a point to keep the end user in mind through every step of the development process and I have no doubt that the impact of that mindset is tangible in the experience that my programs and applications will ultimately provide.
